# Project-2-Confession
Title:
Social Healing

Purpose:
We all have that dark secret we've been dying to get off our chest.
And now you can. At Confessions.com, you can post a secret for the world to see. You also will be given a chance to see into others' secret worlds.

Why should you confess?:
Self improvement is a skill we all value. Reflecting on our past mistakes improves our future decision making as well as establishes a foundation of humility. Confessing our regrets even to ourselves is necessary to becoming a better version of ourselves. If everyone confessed their own mistakes, it would lead to wide spread social healing.


What is it?:
Users (ananymous) will have the opportunity to create their own confessions as well as comment on other confessions.
