# Project-2-Confession
Title:
Social Healing

Purpose:
We all have that dark secret we've been dying to get off our chest.
And now you can. At [include deployment address] you can post a secret for the world to see. You also will be given a chance to see into other people's secret worlds.

Why should you confess?:
Self improvement is a skill we all value. Reflecting on our past mistakes improves our future decision making as well as establishes a foundation of humility. Confessing our regrets even to ourselves is necessary to becoming a better version of ourselves. If everyone confessed their own mistakes, it would lead to wide spread social healing.

Your vulnerability will help encourage others to face with courage those actions that they perceive as shameful.
